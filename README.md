the chaotic dynamics of a dripping faucet was investigated in this experiment.
the experiment was consist of 3 stages:

1 - charachterization of the dynamic and the system's time scales

2 - investigating the affect of hydrodynamic attributes (surface tension, viscosity) on the dynamics

3 - stabilazing the chaos using a forced frequency that was applied upon the system
